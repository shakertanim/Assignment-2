1. Use the command git branch -d about-page to delete the topic branch. Confirm by running git branch that only the main branch is left.


Answer : 

sh-3.2# git branch -d about-page
Deleted branch about-page (was dcf220a).
sh-3.2# git branch
* main



2. InListing3.3,weusedgitcheckout-btocreateabranchandcheck
it out at the same time, but it’s also possible to break this into two steps.
As a first step, use git branch to make a branch with the name test-branch. (This involves passing an argument to git branch, as in git branch <branch name>.) Then confirm that the new branch exists but isn’t currently checked out by running git branch without an argument.


Answer :

sh-3.2# git branch test-branch
sh-3.2# git branch
* main
  test-branch
sh-3.2# 



3. Check out test-branch and use touch to add a file with a name of your choice, then add and commit it to the repository.


Answer : 

sh-3.2# git checkout test-branch
Switched to branch 'test-branch'
sh-3.2# touch IAmSuperLazy.txt
sh-3.2# 
sh-3.2# 
sh-3.2# git add -A
sh-3.2# git commit -am "Added my characteristics file.... I am Super Lazy...."
[test-branch 0f5c9e1] Added my characteristics file.... I am Super Lazy....
 2 files changed, 28 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 3.3.2.txt
 create mode 100644 IAmSuperLazy.txt
sh-3.2# git push
fatal: The current branch test-branch has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin test-branch

To have this happen automatically for branches without a tracking
upstream, see 'push.autoSetupRemote' in 'git help config'.

sh-3.2# git push --set-upstream origin test-branch

4. Check out the main branch and try deleting the test branch using git branch -d to confirm that it doesn’t work. The reason is that, in con­ trast to the about-page branch, the test branch hasn’t been merged into main, and by design -d doesn’t work in this case. Because we don’t actually want its changes, delete the test by using the related -D option, which deletes the branch in question even if its changes are unmerged.


Answer :

sh-3.2# git checkout main
Switched to branch 'main'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
sh-3.2# 
sh-3.2# 
sh-3.2# git branch
* main
  test-branch
sh-3.2# git branch -d test-branch
warning: deleting branch 'test-branch' that has been merged to
         'refs/remotes/origin/test-branch', but not yet merged to HEAD.
Deleted branch test-branch (was 0f5c9e1).
sh-3.2# git branch
