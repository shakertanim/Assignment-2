2. InListing3.3,weusedgitcheckout-btocreateabranchandcheck
it out at the same time, but it’s also possible to break this into two steps.
As a first step, use git branch to make a branch with the name test-branch. (This involves passing an argument to git branch, as in git branch <branch name>.) Then confirm that the new branch exists but isn’t currently checked out by running git branch without an argument.


Answer :

sh-3.2# git branch test-branch
sh-3.2# git branch
* main
  test-branch
sh-3.2# 



3. Check out test-branch and use touch to add a file with a name of your choice, then add and commit it to the repository.
