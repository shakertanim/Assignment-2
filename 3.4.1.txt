The git checkout -f trick works only with files that are staged for commit or are already part of the repository, but sometimes you want to get rid of new files as well. Using touch, create a file with a name of your choice, then git add it. Verify that running git checkout -f gets rid of it.
2. Like many other Unix programs, git accepts both “short form” and “long form” options. Repeat the previous exercise with git checkout --force to confirm that the effects of -f and --force are identical. Extra credit: Double­check this conclusion by finding the “force” option in the output of git help checkout.



Answer :


sh-3.2# echo >> about.html # Appends a newline to about.html
sh-3.2# vi about.html 
sh-3.2# echo > about.html 
sh-3.2# cat about.html 

sh-3.2# git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   about.html

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
